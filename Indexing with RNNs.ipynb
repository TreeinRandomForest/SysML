    "Suppose, we were working with natural text where the tokens were words. To feed in a word like \"apple\" to a neural network, we need to \"numericalize\" (i.e. convert it to a number) it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest solution is to map each unique token to a unique integer. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"apple\" -> 0\n",
    "\n",
    "\"is\" -> 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\"a\" -> 2\n",
    "\n",
    "etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the only requirement is that this mapping is one-to-one i.e. different words are mapped to different integers. The actual mapping, i.e. whether \"apple\" -> 0 or \"apple\" -> 59, doesn't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there any problems with this encoding of tokens? One immediate problem is that it imposes an ordering on the tokens. \"apple\" is not less than \"a\" but 2 < 0. Depending on the machine learning model used, this ordered encoding can induce artifacts that are not real.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this problem is the so-called one-hot encoding. Suppose, there are N distinct words. Each word is mapped to a vector of size N where exactly one entry is 1 and the rest are zeros. Suppose, N = 3. Then,\n",
    "\n",
    "\"apple\" -> [1,0,0]\n",
    "\n",
    "\"is\" -> [0,1,0]\n",
    "\n",
    "\"a\" -> [0,0,1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there is no order imposed on the tokens. Each vector is orthogonal to all other vectors (the dot product of vectors corresponding to distinct words is 0). This creates a couple of problems. If the number of tokens is large, the dimensionality N will also be large and this has implications for memory usage. Another problem is more conceptual. While each word is distinct (by definition) from every other word, words are not distinct by meaning. \"apple\" and \"mango\" are similar in the sense that they are both fruits but they are clearly also distinct (winter vs summer fruit etc.). Since vectors can be used to encode similarity, is it possible to map tokens to vectors such that (a) similar meaning words map to similar vectors and (b) dissimilar meaning words map to dissimilar vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the problem embeddings solve. The philosophy in neural networks is to map each token to a unique vector is a relatively small (compared to the number of distinct tokens, N) dimensional (128 below) vector space. The embeddings are initialized randomly but are also adjusted during the learning process using the same exact process used to adjust/learn weights i.e. by computing derivatives and using gradient descent."

    "* Can each token in the decoder be allowed to search for relevant tokens in the input sentence? This search has to be soft i.e. predict probabilities over the input sequence rather than hard choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this paper, a mechanism (attention) is introduced where, at each time-step in the decoder, a soft search over all hidden states in the encoder is carried out. This search is used to generate a new appropriate context vector that focuses on subsets of the input sequence. In other words, there is no need to encode the full input sequence into *one* context vector. Instead each input sequence is encoded into a sequence of vectors and during decoding, a soft search is carried out over this sequence of vectors."
